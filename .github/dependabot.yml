# NOTE: Dependabot does not have native support for ignoring pre-release versions
# (alpha, beta, rc, etc.) across all ecosystems. See:
# - https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/discussions/10712
# - For Docker: Pre-releases are only suggested if manifest is already on a pre-release
# - For npm/gomod: Manual review of PRs is required to reject pre-release bumps
