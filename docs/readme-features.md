# Features

- **Manage multiple portfolios**:
    - Each portfolio has it own customizable hierarchical structure that must follow a "fractal" pattern
      (the "hierarchy");
    - Inside each portfolio, the assets are classified with data properties that can be chosen as levels (as many as
      needed) of the hierarchy and group them;
    - Each level of the hierarchy has their own set proportions, and can be monitored and balanced as such;
    - In the lowest level of the hierarchy, the assets, there is a classifier for "cash" reserves (assets that can be
      used for risk mitigation
      and [optionality](https://medium.com/@hannes.rollin/antifragile-system-design-1-optionality-17b60fa0842d) if the
      allocation phase demands it);
- **Historical data and visualization**:
    - At any planned (or unplanned) interval a snapshot of the portfolio can be stored to be visualized and used for
      re-balacing (reallocation) analysis;


- **Allocation planning**:
    - Allocation plans following the portfolio structure can be created and used for re-balancing analysis;
    - As time passes, monitoring intervals are reached or maret conditions change, new allocation plans can be created
      and old plans are stored for
      historical analysis;


- **Divergence analysis**:
    - Any historical snapshot of the (allocation of the) portfolio can be conbined to any plan of the same portfolio to
      create a Divergence analysis, illustrating how out of balance the portfolio is from the selected plan;


- **Convergence analysis and planning**:
    - Planned as a future feature;
