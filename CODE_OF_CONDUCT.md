# Contributing guidelines for collaborators

## Code of conduct

Any collaboration to the project is welcomed if created on the intent to improve or advance the project. The author's
main goal is to solve a real-world problem and help others solve theirs. Solving real-world problems means that one has
to understand them to a minimum reasonable depth, and the best practices for that are:

- to have that problem myself and take the steps to solve it myself. If you want to "eat your own dog food", you are in
  the correct place;
- to inform myself on the problem domain and philosophy, principles and rules chosen to solve it. For that,
  make sure to read provided base documentantion and its references and make as many questions as needed or for more
  references. The author is here to help;
- to listen to experience in that problem domain.

**Important PS**: This project contains explorations of technologies the author had not extensive experience on the time
of creation and wanted to learn about, but it is not a technology exploration project. If a technology or stack choice
demonstrates empirically to be unfit, it may be replaced, but that is under the author's discretion.
